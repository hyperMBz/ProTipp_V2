# 4. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## 4.1 Existing Technology Stack

**Languages:** TypeScript 5.8.3, JavaScript (limited)
**Frameworks:** Next.js 15.3.2 (App Router), React 18.3.1
**Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
**Infrastructure:** Netlify deployment, Redis caching (planned)
**External Dependencies:** The Odds API, Stripe (planned), Email service (planned)

## 4.2 Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy:** No database changes required - all work is frontend optimization
**API Integration Strategy:** Maintain existing Supabase integration and auth flows
**Frontend Integration Strategy:** Optimize existing lazy loading and component structure
**Testing Integration Strategy:** Enhance existing Vitest + Playwright test coverage

## 4.3 Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach:** Follow existing component organization in `src/components/home/`
**Naming Conventions:** Maintain existing kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
**Coding Standards:** TypeScript strict mode (currently ignored, needs fixing)
**Documentation Standards:** Update existing component documentation and add performance notes

## 4.4 Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration:** Use existing Netlify build scripts and optimization tools
**Deployment Strategy:** Blue-green deployment with feature flags if needed
**Monitoring and Logging:** Integrate with existing performance monitoring system
**Configuration Management:** Use existing environment variables and build configurations

## 4.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- Bundle size optimization may affect lazy loading performance
- TypeScript strict mode enabling may reveal type errors
- Browser compatibility fixes may introduce new issues
- Performance optimization may conflict with existing caching

**Integration Risks:**
- Auth flow integration may break existing user sessions
- Mobile optimization may affect desktop experience
- SEO changes may impact search rankings

**Deployment Risks:**
- Performance changes may affect production stability
- Browser compatibility fixes may need rollback
- Feature flag management for safe deployment

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive testing before deployment
- Feature flags for safe rollout
- Performance monitoring during deployment
- Automated rollback capabilities
