- [ ] Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)
- [ ] Major Impact (architectural changes required)

## 1.4 Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Achieve Lighthouse Performance Score of 95+ for homepage
- Ensure full mobile responsiveness across all components
- Validate and optimize navigation flow and CTA button routing
- Complete SEO optimization with proper meta tags and Open Graph
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Pass QA Gate requirements for homepage implementation
- Deploy to production with full verification

**Background Context:**
The ProTipp V2 homepage has been built with all major components (Hero, Features, HowItWorks, Testimonials, Stats, CallToAction) and includes lazy loading for performance. However, the final integration testing, mobile optimization, and production readiness steps need to be completed to finish Sprint 1. This enhancement focuses on quality assurance and optimization rather than new feature development.
