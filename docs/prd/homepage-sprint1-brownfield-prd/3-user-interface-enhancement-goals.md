# 3. User Interface Enhancement Goals

## 3.1 Integration with Existing UI

**Existing UI Patterns:**
- Dark theme with purple accent colors
- shadcn/ui component library with Radix primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design tokens
- Consistent gradient backgrounds and hover effects

**Integration Strategy:**
- Maintain existing color scheme and typography
- Use existing component patterns and styling conventions
- Preserve current layout structure and spacing
- Ensure consistent animation and interaction patterns

## 3.2 Modified/New Screens and Views

**Modified Screens:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage root component (navigation flow validation)
- `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` - CTA button routing
- `src/components/home/*.tsx` - Mobile responsive optimization (6 components)
- `src/components/navigation/` - Mobile navigation fixes

**No New Screens Required** - All work is optimization of existing homepage components.

## 3.3 UI Consistency Requirements

**Design System Compliance:**
- All components must use existing Tailwind classes and design tokens
- Gradient backgrounds must match existing patterns
- Button styles must follow established hierarchy
- Typography must use consistent font sizes and weights
- Color usage must follow purple accent theme
- Spacing must follow existing grid system
