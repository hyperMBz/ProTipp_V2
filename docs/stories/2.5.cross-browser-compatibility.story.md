## User Story

**As a** user on any modern browser,
**I want** the homepage to work consistently,
**so that** I have the same experience regardless of browser choice.

## Acceptance Criteria

2.5.1: Chrome 90+ compatibility verified
2.5.2: Firefox 88+ compatibility verified
2.5.3: Safari 14+ compatibility verified
2.5.4: Edge 90+ compatibility verified
2.5.5: No browser-specific bugs or layout issues
2.5.6: Polyfills implemented for required features

## Integration Verification

IV2.5.1: Browser compatibility fixes don't break existing functionality
IV2.5.2: Polyfills don't significantly increase bundle size
IV2.5.3: Cross-browser testing doesn't reveal new issues

## Technical Requirements

TR2.5.1: CSS vendor prefixes for cross-browser support
TR2.5.2: JavaScript feature detection and polyfills
TR2.5.3: Browser-specific CSS fixes and workarounds
TR2.5.4: Web API compatibility checks
TR2.5.5: Font loading cross-browser optimization
TR2.5.6: Media query and responsive design validation

## Implementation Plan

IP2.5.1: Set up automated cross-browser testing
IP2.5.2: Identify browser-specific issues and inconsistencies
IP2.5.3: Implement CSS vendor prefixes and fallbacks
IP2.5.4: Add JavaScript polyfills for unsupported features
IP2.5.5: Test layout consistency across browsers
IP2.5.6: Validate interactive elements functionality
IP2.5.7: Document browser support matrix

## Definition of Done

DoD2.5.1: All supported browsers tested and verified
DoD2.5.2: Browser compatibility matrix documented
DoD2.5.3: No critical browser-specific bugs remain
DoD2.5.4: Polyfills implemented and tested
DoD2.5.5: Code reviewed and approved
DoD2.5.6: Cross-browser test suite created

## Test Cases

TC2.5.1: Chrome 90+ layout and functionality
TC2.5.2: Firefox 88+ layout and functionality
TC2.5.3: Safari 14+ layout and functionality
TC2.5.4: Edge 90+ layout and functionality
TC2.5.5: Mobile Safari compatibility
TC2.5.6: CSS Grid and Flexbox support
TC2.5.7: JavaScript ES6+ feature support
TC2.5.8: Font loading and rendering consistency

## Risk Assessment

RA2.5.1: Medium - Safari-specific issues (mitigation: extensive testing)
RA2.5.2: Low - Polyfill conflicts (mitigation: selective implementation)
RA2.5.3: Medium - Vendor prefix maintenance (mitigation: automated tools)

## Notes

- Focus on modern browser support (last 2 versions)
- Use Autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixes
- Implement feature detection before polyfills
- Test on real devices when possible
- Document any browser-specific workarounds
- Consider progressive enhancement approach
