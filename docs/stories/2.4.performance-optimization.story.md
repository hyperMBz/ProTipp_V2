# Story 2.4: Performance Optimization

## Story Information

- **Epic**: Homepage Sprint 1 Completion (Epic 2)
- **Story Number**: 2.4
- **Sprint**: Homepage Sprint 1 - Performance & Quality
- **Priority**: P1 (High)
- **Estimated Effort**: 8 Story Points (4-6 Ã³ra)
- **Dependencies**: Story 2.2, Story 2.3 (Mobile + SEO)
- **Status**: Ready

## User Story

**As a** user with slow internet connection,
**I want** the homepage to load quickly,
**so that** I can access content without long waiting times.

## Acceptance Criteria

2.4.1: Lighthouse Performance Score reaches 95+
2.4.2: First Contentful Paint under 1.5 seconds
2.4.3: Largest Contentful Paint under 2.0 seconds
2.4.4: Cumulative Layout Shift under 0.05
2.4.5: Bundle size remains within performance budget
2.4.6: Lazy loading optimization is effective

## Integration Verification

IV2.4.1: Existing functionality performance is maintained
IV2.4.2: Lazy loading doesn't break component interactions
IV2.4.3: Bundle size optimization doesn't remove needed code

## Technical Requirements

TR2.4.1: Next.js Image optimization for all images
TR2.4.2: Code splitting and dynamic imports
TR2.4.3: Bundle analysis and optimization
TR2.4.4: Critical CSS inlining
TR2.4.5: Font loading optimization
TR2.4.6: CDN and caching strategy

## Implementation Plan

IP2.4.1: Run Lighthouse audit on current homepage
IP2.4.2: Optimize images with Next.js Image component
IP2.4.3: Implement code splitting for large components
IP2.4.4: Optimize font loading and rendering
IP2.4.5: Minimize and compress assets
IP2.4.6: Implement caching strategies
IP2.4.7: Validate performance improvements

## Definition of Done

DoD2.4.1: Lighthouse Performance score 95+ achieved
DoD2.4.2: Core Web Vitals all in green
DoD2.4.3: Bundle size optimization completed
DoD2.4.4: Performance regression tests passing
DoD2.4.5: Code reviewed and approved
DoD2.4.6: Performance metrics documented

## Test Cases

TC2.4.1: Lighthouse Performance audit (95+ score)
TC2.4.2: First Contentful Paint timing (<1.5s)
TC2.4.3: Largest Contentful Paint timing (<2.0s)
TC2.4.4: Cumulative Layout Shift (<0.05)
TC2.4.5: Bundle size analysis and optimization
TC2.4.6: Lazy loading effectiveness verification
TC2.4.7: Cross-device performance consistency

## Risk Assessment

RA2.4.1: Medium - Bundle size increase (mitigation: careful optimization)
RA2.4.2: Low - Lazy loading issues (mitigation: thorough testing)
RA2.4.3: High - Performance regression (mitigation: performance monitoring)

## Notes

- Focus on Core Web Vitals optimization
- Maintain existing lazy loading architecture
- Use performance budgets to prevent regression
- Document performance improvements
- Implement performance monitoring for production
- Consider mobile performance as primary metric
