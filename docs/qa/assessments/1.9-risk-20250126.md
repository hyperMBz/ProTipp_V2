**Story**: 1.9 Security and Compliance Enhancement  

## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Severity |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| SEC-001 | Security hook tests failing | Medium | Medium | 6 | Medium |
| SEC-002 | API signature mismatches | Low | Low | 3 | Low |
| SEC-003 | Test execution stability | Medium | Low | 4 | Low |

## Risk Details

### SEC-001: Security Hook Tests Failing
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5)
- **Impact**: Medium (3/5)
- **Risk Score**: 6 (3×3)
- **Description**: Security hook tests are failing due to mock data type mismatches and integration issues
- **Mitigation**: Fix mock data types and ensure proper integration between hooks and security managers
- **Owner**: Development Team

### SEC-002: API Signature Mismatches
- **Probability**: Low (2/5)
- **Impact**: Low (2/5)
- **Risk Score**: 3 (2×2)
- **Description**: Some API signatures between security managers and hooks don't match
- **Mitigation**: Standardize API design across security layer
- **Owner**: Development Team

### SEC-003: Test Execution Stability
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5)
- **Impact**: Low (2/5)
- **Risk Score**: 4 (3×2)
- **Description**: Test execution is unstable due to remaining integration issues
- **Mitigation**: Improve test infrastructure and fix remaining integration bugs
- **Owner**: Development Team

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Total Risk Score**: 13  
**Risk Level**: **MEDIUM**  
**Recommendation**: Proceed with caution, fix critical test issues before production deployment

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
1. Fix remaining test execution issues
2. Ensure all security hooks properly integrate with security managers
3. Validate API signatures across security layer

### Medium-term Actions (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. Add comprehensive integration tests for security flows
2. Implement security testing automation
3. Establish security testing best practices

### Long-term Actions (Next Quarter)
1. Implement continuous security testing
2. Add security performance monitoring
3. Establish security testing metrics and KPIs

## Conclusion

While all security features have been implemented according to requirements, the current test execution issues pose a medium risk to production deployment. The team should focus on resolving these issues before considering the story production-ready.
