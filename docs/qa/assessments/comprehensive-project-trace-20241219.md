   - Mobile testing using BrowserStack or similar
   - Accessibility testing using axe-core
   - Integration tests for settings persistence

3. **Test Data Requirements**:
   - Large datasets for performance testing
   - Various device configurations for mobile testing
   - Accessibility test scenarios
   - Analytics data for dashboard testing

4. **Mock/Stub Strategies**:

   - Mock user interactions for accessibility testing

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Performance requirements with no coverage
- **Medium Risk**: Analytics, settings, and mobile with partial coverage
- **Low Risk**: Core functionality with full coverage

### Quality Gate Impact

- **Critical Gaps**: 2 requirements (6%)
- **Partial Coverage**: 5 requirements (14%)
- **Full Coverage**: 28 requirements (80%)

**Gate Decision**: CONCERNS - Due to critical performance gaps and partial coverage in key areas

### Recommendations for Improvement
