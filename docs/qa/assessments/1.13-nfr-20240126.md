# NFR Assessment: 1.13

Date: 2024-01-26
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Static components, no user input
- Performance: CONCERNS - No lazy loading, bundle size not optimized
- Reliability: PASS - Error boundaries not needed for static content
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - No test coverage for home components

## Critical Issues

1. **No test coverage** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Untested code paths, regression potential
   - Fix: Add unit tests for all home components

2. **No lazy loading** (Performance)
   - Risk: Large initial bundle size, slow page load
   - Fix: Implement lazy loading for home sections

## Quick Wins

- Add unit tests: ~4 hours
- Implement lazy loading: ~2 hours
- Add performance monitoring: ~1 hour
- Bundle size optimization: ~2 hours

## Detailed Assessment

### Security: PASS
- Static components with no user input
- No authentication/authorization required
- No data processing or storage
- CTA links are static, no injection risks

### Performance: CONCERNS
- All components load immediately (no lazy loading)
- Bundle size not analyzed
- No performance monitoring implemented
- Missing image optimization for potential future images

### Reliability: PASS
- Static content with no external dependencies
- No error-prone operations
- Graceful degradation with CSS fallbacks
- No network calls or data processing

### Maintainability: CONCERNS
- No unit tests for home components
- No integration tests for component interactions
- No visual regression tests
- Good code structure and TypeScript usage
