|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| OPS-001 | Missing test coverage for home components | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High |
| PERF-001 | Large bundle size from multiple components | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **OPS-001**: Unit tests for all home components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Visual regression tests for responsive design

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **PERF-001**: Bundle size analysis and optimization
- **BUS-001**: SEO meta tags validation
- Performance testing for page load times

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Error boundary testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6+)
- Medium risks affecting user experience

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Low risks with monitoring in place
- Minimal risks with documentation

### Accepted Risks

- SEC-001: CTA links are static, no user input required
- OPS-003: Basic monitoring can be added post-deployment

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Page load times for PERF risks
- Error rates for OPS risks
- SEO performance for BUS risks
- User engagement metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New home components added
- Performance issues reported
- SEO requirements change
- Accessibility standards updated
