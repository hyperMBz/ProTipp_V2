You have access to a team of specialized AI agents. Each agent has unique expertise and can be activated using slash commands.

## Team Composition

### Core Development Team
- `/analyst` - Business Analysis & Requirements
- `/pm` - Product Management & Strategy  
- `/ux-expert` - User Experience & Interface Design
- `/design-agent` - AI Design Generation with SuperDesign
- `/architect` - Technical Architecture & System Design
- `/dev` - Full-Stack Development & Implementation
- `/qa` - Quality Assurance & Testing
- `/sm` - Scrum Master & Process Management

### Enhanced Design Workflow

#### Traditional BMAD Flow
```
Analyst → PM → UX-Expert → Architect → Dev → QA
```

#### SuperDesign Enhanced Flow
```
Analyst → PM → UX-Expert → Design-Agent → Architect → Dev → QA
                    ↓           ↓
              front-end-spec → visual mockups → implementation prompts
```

## Design-Enhanced Workflows

### 1. Greenfield Projects with Design Focus
```
/analyst    # Create project brief
/pm         # Generate PRD
/ux-expert  # Create front-end specifications
/design-agent # Generate visual mockups with SuperDesign
/architect  # Technical architecture with design constraints
/dev        # Implementation using design artifacts
/qa         # Test against design specifications
```

### 2. UI Component Development
```
/ux-expert    # Define component requirements
/design-agent # Create component variations in SuperDesign
/dev          # Implement with shadcn/ui
/qa           # Validate against design mockups
```

### 3. Design System Evolution
```
/design-agent # Generate new component designs
/ux-expert    # Validate user experience
/architect    # Assess technical feasibility
/dev          # Implement and integrate
```

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Design-Agent Collaboration
- **Receives from UX-Expert**: Detailed specifications and user requirements
- **Provides to Architect**: Visual constraints and design system requirements
- **Provides to Dev**: Implementation prompts and component specifications
- **Collaborates with QA**: Design validation criteria and visual testing requirements

### Enhanced Handoffs
1. **UX-Expert → Design-Agent**: front-end-spec.md → visual mockups
2. **Design-Agent → Architect**: design constraints → technical feasibility
3. **Design-Agent → Dev**: component prompts → implementation guidance
4. **Design-Agent → QA**: visual specifications → testing criteria

## SuperDesign Integration Points

### Project Setup
- Configure SuperDesign for project design system
- Set up component templates and style guides
- Establish design token integration

### Development Workflow
- Generate mockups before coding
- Create component variations for testing
- Iterate designs based on user feedback
- Export implementation prompts for developers

### Quality Assurance
- Visual regression testing against SuperDesign mockups
- Design system compliance validation
- Cross-device design consistency checks

## Quick Commands

### Start Design-Enhanced Development
```
/design-agent Generate initial dashboard mockups for sports betting platform
```

### Component-Focused Development
```
/design-agent Create betting odds comparison table variations
/dev Implement the selected design with shadcn/ui
```

### Design System Work
```
/design-agent Evolve current design system with new components
/architect Assess technical implications of design changes
```

This enhanced team provides a complete design-to-development pipeline with AI-powered visual generation, making BMAD workflows more comprehensive and design-focused.
